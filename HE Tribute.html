        <h3 class="title-text">History </h3>
        <h4 class="body-text">Honest Ed's was a landmark discount store located in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It was named for its proprietor, Ed Mirvish,
                who opened the store in 1948 and oversaw its operations for almost 60 years, until his death in 2007. The store continued in operation until it was
                permanently closed on December 31, 2016.

                Ed and Anne Mirvish opened "The Sport's Bar", a women's clothing store, near Bloor and Bathurst Streets in 1943 renting a property that was five metres wide.
                The store proved popular. In 1946, the Mirvishes expanded after acquiring several buildings along Bloor, renaming the store "Anne and Eddie's". After a further
                expansion, Mirvish re-established the store as "Honest Ed's Bargain House" in 1948, adding general household goods to the inventory. In 1952, the Mirvishes
                acquired their first property on Markham Street, behind the store and eventually acquired several more homes on the street with the intent of building a parking lot.
                Instead, this eventually evolved into the Mirvish Village neighbourhood in the 1960s after the city turned down the store's application to raze the buildings and Anne
                Mirvish persuaded her husband to rent the houses out to artists. In 1958, "Honest Ed's" expanded west to Markham Street to encompass 6,000 square feet and in 1984,
                the Honest Ed's annex building was completed expanding the store east to Bathurst Street.

                The main building was at 581 Bloor Street West and the annex at 760 Bloor Street West with the two connected by a walkway crossing Honest Ed Alley.
                Honest Ed's gained fame for its marketing stunts, including loss leader specials. By 1968 the store was grossing $14 million annually. Mirvish's turkey giveaway
                before Christmas each year always received media attention; this annual event continued even after his death, until the Christmas season of 2015. Mirvish also
                threw birthday parties for himself from 1988 until his death, continued since then as anniversary parties for the store itself. At the street parties, there were
                free cakes, meals, hot dogs, candy, and giveaways. Crowds of Torontonians turned up with their children, and stood in long lines to receive these handouts.
                The event was accompanied by live bands and balloons.

        <h3 class="title-text">Cultural Impact</h3>
        <h4 class="body-text">The store has appeared in several films and television shows shot in Toronto. For example, Honest Ed's was featured in the film The Long Kiss Goodnight,
                and can be seen in several background scenes in the film Scott Pilgrim vs. the World when Scott and his friends are dining at Pizza Pizza across the street from the store.

                One of the fight sequences in the third volume of Bryan Lee O'Malley's Scott Pilgrim comic book series takes place at Honest Ed's, with the characters suffering sensory
                overload due to the incredible amounts of merchandise. The store implodes after Scott's rival Todd breaks an agreement not to use his psychic powers.
